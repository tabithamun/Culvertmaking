    I have decided to come up with this idea of making the mechanized culvert that lasts for long in order to supply to countries affected by floods
    Mostly our country and especially our area located near l.Baringo <br>
    Flooding has been the main issue arising  many times without controlability<br>Moreover this issue has not been taken seriosly by the goverment.<br>

PROBLEM
  <br>    Flooding has bring much effect in our area including animal and human death rates</br>
      This has been the main effect leading to low population in our country<br>
      They are many other effects like:lodging in crops mechanized and away of the fertile soils leading to hunger and starvation because of lack of food<br>
<p>I amngengeto solving this problem with supply of culvert in countries with this problem of floods and this will bring change<br>
